# This is a websocket app for using any switch as a pc controller.

Slapped together with a gotham example and some spaghetti code.
Because of the used crates it's currently not compatible with other operating systems then Windows.

# Usage:

By using "switch_layout.txt" as a template make a "layout.txt" file.
Note, the right stick's movement is automatically mapped to mouse movement, so it's not re-mappable.

Put the compiled file, layout file and "index.html" file in one folder, than follow these steps to get it working:

- 1) Run the executable
- 2) Enter the URL it gives on your switch's browser 
    (follow this guide if you don't know how to access the browser, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKueqoPUm7k)
- 3) Enjoy
